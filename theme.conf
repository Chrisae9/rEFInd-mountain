# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144) 
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the 
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for 
# the big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given, 
# the built-in default will be used for the small icons. 
# 
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of an 
# uncompressed BMP image file with a color depth of 24, 8, 4, or 1 bits, 
# or a PNG image. The PNG format is required if you need transparency 
# support (to let you "see through" to a full-screen banner).
